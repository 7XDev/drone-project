# Drone Show

A comprehensive website designed to provide detailed guidance on building and 3D printing drones, utilizing the provided control software to operate them, and creating captivating drone shows.

## Website Overview

The website is envisioned to resemble the layout and functionality of [GitBook](https://homeverse.gitbook.io/home-verse-technical-document), offering a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

### Webpages Structure

The website will feature a series of webpages that outline the various steps involved in constructing, programming, and operating drones, as well as using the associated software to design immersive drone shows.
