It’s a small computer that handles communication between drones and processes commands. Think of it as the control center for the entire system.

## The Drone Itself

- **[Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3 (Pre-Soldered Pins)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008675728246.html)** (~15€, ~3.7g): This tiny board is like a mini-computer for the drone. It connects to WiFi and Bluetooth, making it perfect for controlling the drone’s movements wirelessly.
- **[Oversky D0603 Micro Brushless Motors (14000KV, 4x)](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005001693115290.html)** (~44€ for 4, ~1.5g each): These small but powerful motors spin the propellers, allowing the drone to fly. They are lightweight and designed for quick, agile movements.
- **[BETAFPV LAVA 1S 300mAh 75C LiPo Batteries (2x)](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005008753474930.html)** (~32€ for 5, ~7g each): These are the batteries that power the drone. They are small and light but provide enough energy for short flights.
- **[LDARC 65mm 2-Blade Propellers (20pcs CW/CCW)](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000571823620.html)** (~5€, ~0.2g each): These propellers are attached to the motors and generate lift, allowing the drone to fly. They are lightweight and efficient.
- **[Micro 1S 4A Brushless ESC (4x Individual)](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006197408875.html)** (~10€ for 4, ~1g each): These are electronic speed controllers. They manage the power going to the motors, ensuring smooth and precise control.
- **[GY-521 MPU6050 IMU Module](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005008741573041.html)** (~1€, ~2g): This sensor helps the drone stay stable during flight. It detects movement and adjusts the motors to keep the drone balanced.
- **[TC4056A Micro USB LiPo Charger (1-10PCS)](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004277584923.html)** (~4€ for 2): This is a simple charger for the drone’s batteries. It ensures the batteries are safely charged and ready for use.
- **[Mini 5V 0.5A BEC Step-Down Regulator](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005001303802541.html)** (~2€, ~1g): This device converts the battery’s voltage to a level that the drone’s electronics can use. It’s small and lightweight.
- **[Mini PDB Power Distribution Board](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004096995692.html)** (~5€, ~3g): This board distributes power from the battery to all the drone’s components. It also has built-in voltage regulators to keep everything running smoothly.
- **[Silicone Wire & JST Connectors Kit (Minimal)](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005003667885925.html)** (~3€): These are thin wires and connectors used to link all the drone’s parts together. They are lightweight to keep the drone as light as possible.

## Miscellaneous

- **[Carbon Fibre PLA](https://eu.elegoo.com/de-at/products/pla-cf-filament-1-75mm-black-1kg)** (~22€): This is a special type of 3D printing filament made from carbon fiber and PLA (a biodegradable plastic). It’s used to print lightweight and strong parts for the drone, such as the frame or custom mounts.
