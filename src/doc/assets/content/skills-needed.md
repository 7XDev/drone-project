## Basic Electronics
- Understanding how to connect components like motors, sensors, and batteries.
- Familiarity with soldering wires and using tools like multimeters.

## Programming
- Basic knowledge of programming languages like `C` or `C++`.
- Ability to flash firmware onto microcontrollers and modify source code.

## Mechanical Assembly
- Skills to assemble the drone frame and attach components securely.
- Ability to follow step-by-step instructions for building the drone.

## Problem-Solving
- Troubleshooting issues with hardware connections or software configurations.
- Adapting to unexpected challenges during the building process.

## 3D Printing
