# Exploring Component

This section provides a detailed overview of each component, explaining its purpose, functionality, and how it integrates into the overall system. Alongside the descriptions, you will find simple example programs designed to help you test and understand the behavior of each component in isolation. These examples serve as a starting point for experimenting with the components and exploring their potential applications. By the end of this section, you should have a solid understanding of how each part works and how to use it effectively in your projects.
