## Notes

 - !!! topic-category-button initialization is kind of messed up. The button needs to clicks to work on the first click after that works. I might fix that tomorrow but you can try that if you want 
 - !!! topic-category-button doesnt apply for some reason so maybe fix that if you want
 - Using svg instead of unicode arrow now
 - Improved style for topic-category-buttons
 - Fixed major performance issue with nested forEachs in script.js
 - Fixed topic generation issue in content-browser.js
 - Made toggle and detoggle in script.js also use functionality from content-browser.js
 - Reworked DOMContentLoaded with seperate methods for initialization of button in script.js

```
